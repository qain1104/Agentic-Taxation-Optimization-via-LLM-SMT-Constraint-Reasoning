# SMT Solver Configuration (Z3)

## Docker (recommended)

For ICSE AE, the Docker image includes the Python dependency `z3-solver`.
No additional system-wide Z3 installation is required.

## Local Python (optional)

If you choose to run without Docker, install:

```bash
pip install z3-solver
```

Some environments may prefer a system Z3 package; consult your OS package manager if needed.
